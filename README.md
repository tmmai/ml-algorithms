## Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal of this project is to implement common ML algorithms from scratch using Numpy. The goal is not to achieve high levels of accuracy on individual projects but primarily to learn underlying foundational understanding of common ML models. 

My reasoning is because wrestling through the algorithm implementations themselves (vs. starting with calling a prepackaged library) helps me develop a solid foundation of mathematical understanding and general intuition behind the algorithms, in hopes that in the future when I apply them I will understand what models to use when and why, what they're doing underneath the hood, and how to approach debugging when issues arise.

## Status: Work In Progress

This project is currently in progress. I will add algorithms as I go.
