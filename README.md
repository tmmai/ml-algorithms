## Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal of this project is to implement common ML algorithms from scratch using Numpy. The goal is not to achieve high levels of accuracy on individual projects but primarily to learn underlying foundational understanding of common ML models.

## Status: Work In Progress

This project is currently in progress. I will add algorithms as I go.
