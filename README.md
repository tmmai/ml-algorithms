## Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal of this project is to implement common ML algorithms from scratch using Numpy. The goal is not to achieve high levels of accuracy on individual projects but primarily to learn underlying foundational understanding of common ML models. I think understanding the ins-and-outs of how algorithms are built vs. jumping straight to using pre-packaged libraries is a similar difference compared to understanding how to implement sorting algorithms vs. calling .sort(). 

## Status: Work In Progress

This project is currently in progress. I will add algorithms as I go.

Thank you for reading! Please feel free to let me know if there's any resources like must-read research articles/books and critical concepts related to ML/NLP/DL that can aid in my learning process!
